# Pi remote shutter controller interface
This project is a hack for your home shutters remote control.
Some manufacturers does not allow you to control you shutters via you own
antenna and a Raspberry.

My example is based on the Jarolift `TDRC-08W`, for which I solded wires and connected them to a breadboard:
